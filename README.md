# bash-things
A repo for my common custom BASH things.

## `.bash_aliases`

A common file placed in your `$HOME` directory (`~`) which gets called on each instantiation of a new shell. This file contains aliases for common commands I use often. As well as a custom command prompt that is two lines long. The first line is important things like the absolute path to your present working directory (`pwd`), your username, and the server you're on. The second line is just a greater-than symbol (`>`) for the actual prompt.
